1,"Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents."
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services. For more information on the concepts, methods and quality of the data contained in this table, please contact the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics at statcan.ccjcss-ccsjsc.statcan@statcan.gc.ca."
3,"The violent crime category has been expanded under the Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) to include a number of offences not previously included in the violent crime category, including uttering threats, criminal harassment and forcible confinement. Therefore, total violent crime counts in this table will not match total violent crime counts from the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR)."
4,"Homicide data are extracted from the homicide survey database. For further information, refer to: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3315-eng.htm."
5,"Robbery counts have been revised for the years 1998 to 2007. This change has resulted in an increase of approximately 12% annually in the number of reported robbery incidents for this time period. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years."
6,"Counterfeiting counts have been revised for the years 1998 to 2007. This change has resulted in a significant decrease in counterfeiting incidents over this time period. Use with caution when comparing these data with prior years."
7,"There is a break in the time series in the offensive weapons category due to different offences being assigned to the weapons offence codes in 1999. Use with caution when comparing these data with prior years."
8,"Any increase in disturbing the peace violations may be, in part, attributable to a national data quality initiative undertaken by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to properly account for the types of offences that are aggregated under this offence."
9,"This represents the year-over-year (current year over last year) percentage change in the rate of actual incidents."
10,"Total persons charged is the total of adults charged and youth charged."
11,"In general, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) counts any adult and youth charged for the year in which the charge was laid. The homicide totals, which come from The Homicide Survey, count any adult or youth charged with a homicide that occurred in the reference year, regardless of when the charge was laid."
12,"Any reference to Police Officer has been changed to read Peace Officer, as per the Canadian Criminal Code. Peace officer refers to any person employed for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace or for the service or execution of civil process. Examples of a Peace Officer are a mayor, warden, police officer, or bailiff constable. Please see the Canadian Criminal Code for a complete list of designates."
13,"Sexual violations against children is a new crime category with only partial data available prior to 2008. As a result, numbers and rates should not be directly compared to data from previous years."
14,"In 2002, legislative changes were made to include the use of the Internet for the purpose of committing child pornography offences. As such, the percent change in this offence is calculated from 2003 to 2009."
15,"In January 2010, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) was modified to create new violation codes for identity fraud and identity theft. Prior to 2010, those offences would have been coded as fraud."
16,"Historically police services have reported kidnapping and forcible confinement under a single combined violation code. In 2008 the Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) introduced separate codes for these violations which police services utilize as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them. As a result, comparison with previous years should be done with caution."
17,"In 2009, legislation was introduced to create the offences of assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm to a peace officer (level 2) and aggravated assault to a peace officer (level 3). The introduction of these new codes into the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) created a system anomaly which resulted in some non-peace officer assaults being coded as peace officer assaults in 2010. Comparisons to 2010 should be made with caution."
18,"For the period from 1998 to 2007 Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data on criminal harassment are not available for all respondents. In order to report this violation for police services still reporting to the aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts using the distribution of 'other' Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) respondents."
19,"Data on youth charged and youth not charged may include a small number of people under the age of 12."
20,"Data for youth charged and youth not charged for impaired driving are not available prior to 2007. As a result, comparisons of Total all violations and Total Criminal Code violations (including traffic) over time should be made with caution."
21,"In April 2011, legislation came into effect making it an offence to traffic in property obtained by crime, including possession with intent to traffic property obtained by crime. In addition to creating new Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) violation codes to capture these offences, the existing UCR violation code pertaining to possession of stolen property was modified. The UCR now separates possession of stolen property into possession of stolen property under $5,000 and possession of stolen property over $5,000 in order to be more in line with the Criminal Code of Canada. As a result of this change, a number of incidents of possession of stolen property under $5,000 are now being reported as secondary offences when they occur in conjunction with more serious offences, leading to a decrease in the number of possession of stolen property incidents reported in 2011."
22,"In April 2011, legislation came into effect making it an offence to traffic in property obtained by crime, including possession with intent to traffic property obtained by crime. The Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) introduced two new violations codes to collect this information. They are Trafficking in Stolen Goods over $5,000 (including possession with intent to traffic) and Trafficking in Stolen Goods under $5,000 (including possession with intent to traffic)."
23,"In 2011, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was amended to make it illegal for anyone to possess, produce, sell or import anything knowing it will be used to produce or traffic in crystal meth or ecstasy. The Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) introduced a new violation code to collect this information."
24,"In 2011, the Criminal Code was amended to make it illegal for anyone to alter, destroy or remove a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) introduced a new violation code to collect this information."
25,"Detailed information of this category is available upon request."
26,"During the revision of 2001 data for the province of Ontario, a discrepancy in methodology applied by the forces in the province using the Ontario Municipal and Provincial Police Automated Co-operative (OMPPAC) system was detected. These forces report approximately one-third of the total criminal incidents for the province and include the Ontario Provincial Police and about 60 small and mid-sized municipal forces. This discrepancy resulted in an over-count of less serious criminal incidents. During 2003 and 2004, the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS) consulted with affected police services and analyzed both historical Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) data and more recent Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) microdata to determine the impact of this over-reporting. The effect at the Canada level was, on average, 1% per year from 1977 to 2000. This over-counting peaked in 1991, where it was estimated that the total crime rate for the country was over-estimated by approximately 1.8%. However, the overall historical trend changed very little. The impact in Ontario is more noticeable, but the overall trend is still very similar. On average, the effect was 2% to 3% per year, with the biggest change occurring in 1991, where the Ontario crime rate is 5% lower as a result of the adjustment. For further information, refer to the report:<a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/document/3302_D13_T9_V1-eng.pdf">Summary of Historical Adjustments to Crime Data for Ontario 1977-2000</a>."
27,"With the release of 2012 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2004."
28,"In August 2012, legislation came into effect making it an offence to make sexually explicit material available to a child for the purpose of facilitating sexual offences against children/youth. The Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) introduced a new violation code to collect this information."
29,"Ottawa numbers also include child pornography incidents reported by the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which is located in the City of Ottawa. The Centre responds to internet-facilitated sexual abuse cases nationally. Therefore, while the incidents are detected by the RCMP Centre located in Ottawa and appear in Ottawa's crime statistics, the incidents themselves or the offenders are not limited to the city of Ottawa."
30,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident."
31,"Crime data for 2012 are estimates. Therefore, please use caution when comparing these data with previous years."
32,"Due to the complexity of these incidents, the data likely reflect the number of active or closed investigations for the year rather than the total number of incidents reported to police."
33,"The crime statistics reported for this police service contain a notable proportion of incidents that occur within the local correctional facility. For further details, contact the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics at statcan.ccjcss-ccsjsc.statcan@statcan.gc.ca."
34,"Previous to 2014, Greater Sudbury (35290) would record only those incidents where a search warrant was obtained and a charge related to child pornography was laid. As of 2014, reporting practices have changed to include all information of IP addresses with links to child pornography for information gathering and intelligence purposes. Therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution."
35,"Starting in 2003, populations for all police services including all rural/provincial detachments have been presented. Prior to 2003, populations for rural detachments are not available."
36,"In 2014, legislation was introduced to create the offence of Mischief to war memorials (Bill C-217).  The offence of mischief in relation to cultural property was also introduced as a result of this legislation.  Police services are able to utilise these codes as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them.  As a result, these data may be under-counted and should therefore be interpreted with caution."
37,"Bill C-36 came into effect in December 2014. The new legislation targets "the exploitation that is inherent in prostitution and the risks of violence posed to those who engage in it" (Criminal Code Chapter 25, preamble). New violations classified as ”Offences in Relation to Sexual Services” under "violations against the person" include: the purchasing of sexual services or communicating for that purpose, receiving a material benefit deriving from the purchase of sexual services, procuring of persons for the purpose of prostitution, and advertising sexual services offered for sale. In addition, a number of other offences related to prostitution continue to be considered non-violent offences and are classified under "Other Criminal Code offences". These include communicating to provide sexual services for consideration, and; offences related to impeding traffic to buy or sell sexual services. At the same time, the survey was amended to classify the violations codes of Parent or guardian procuring sexual activity, and Householder permitting prohibited sexual activity under "violations against the person". The following violations officially expired on December 05, 2014: bawdy house, living off the avails of prostitution of a person under 18, procuring, obtains/communicates with a person under 18 for purpose of sex, and other prostitution. Police services are able to utilize these codes as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow it. As a result, these data should be interpreted with caution."
38,"In April of 2013, the Government of Canada introduced a new bill entitled "An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Canada Evidence Act and the Security of Information Act" (Bill S-7). As a result of this new legislation, the following Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) violation codes were introduced: leave Canada to participate in activity of a terrorist group, leave Canada to facilitate terrorist activity, leave Canada to commit an offence for a terrorist group, leave Canada to commit an offence that is a terrorist activity, harbour/conceal known terrorist where terrorist activity had max = life, harbour/conceal known terrorist where terrorist activity had max not = life, harbour/conceal person likely to carry out terrorist activity. Police services are able to utilise these codes as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them. As a result, these data may be under-counted and should therefore be interpreted with caution."
39,"On June 19, 2014, the Canadian Government granted royal assent to Bill C-394 "An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the National Defence Act (criminal organization recruitment)". The Come into Force date for this Act was June 19, 2014. As a result, the following violation was introduced: recruitment of members by a criminal organization. Police services are able to utilise this code as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow it. As a result, these data should be interpreted with caution."
40,"Ontario numbers also include child pornography incidents reported by the Canadian Police Centre for Missing and Exploited Children of the RCMP which is located in the City of Ottawa. The Centre responds to Internet-facilitated sexual abuse cases nationally. Therefore, while the incidents are detected by the RCMP Centre located in Ontario, the incidents themselves or the offenders are not limited to the province of Ontario."
41,"Prior to 2013, all incidents of child pornography recorded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Service's Canadian Police Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (CPCMEC), located in Ottawa, were reported under the Ottawa Police Service. In 2014, Statistics Canada began reporting CPCMEC data separately and revised data for 2013 to account for this change. As a result of revisions to the 2013 data, some incidents identified by the CPCMEC and referred to the Ottawa Police Service for investigation may have been transferred to the CPCMEC. As such, the revised number of incidents for Ottawa Police Service for 2013 may be underrepresented and should not be compared to other years."
42,"Historically, police service reported all child pornography offences under a single combined violation code, of which the majority of the offences were possessing child pornography. In early 2016, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) was modified to allow police to report making and distributing child pornography from other child pornography offences (i.e., possession and accessing child pornography). Since police services are able to utilize these codes as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them, a few were reported in 2015. As a result, these data should therefore be interpreted with caution."
43,"Coming into effect on July 17th, 2015, Bill C-26 increased the maximum penalties for certain sexual offences against children, including failure to comply with orders and probation conditions relating to sexual offences against children. In the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR), the most serious violation is partially determined by the maximum penalty. As such, changes in maximum penalty may affect the most serious violation in an incident reported by police. Police services are able to utilize these amendments as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them."
44,"On April 10, 2015, Bill C-10 Tackling Contraband Tobacco Act came into effect. As a result, this law created the Criminal Code offence of trafficking in contraband tobacco which is counted under the violation "Offences against the administration of law and justice". Prior to April 2015, the offence was counted under "Excise Act". As such, comparisons of these two violations to previous years should be made with caution."
45,"Effective December 2014, Bill C-36 amended the definition of the term "common bawdy house" in the Criminal Code to remove reference to prostitution. As a result of this amendment, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) violation of "Bawdy house" was terminated, and the new violation of "Common bawdy house" was introduced. Police services are able to utilise this amendment as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow it. As a result, these data should be interpreted with caution."
46,"Includes Criminal Code violations that specifically concern offences involving child and youth victims. These include sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching, sexual exploitation, making sexually explicit material available to children for the purpose of facilitating sexual offences against children/youth, luring a child via a computer, parent or guardian procuring sexual activity, householder permitting prohibited sexual activity, agreement or arrangement and bestiality in presence of, or incites, a child. Incidents of child pornography are not included in the category of sexual violations against children. Excludes incidents of sexual assault levels 1, 2 and 3 against children and youth which are counted within those three violation categories. Other sexual offences not involving assault or sexual violations against children are included with "other violent offences"."
47,"Due to the length of time for investigations to confirm whether or not the incident is founded, annual counts of terrorism offences are subject to revisions downwards when revised data are released one year after the initial release. Therefore, changes between the current year of data and the previous year should be interpreted with caution."
48,"On March 9, 2015, Bill C-13 Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act came into effect. As a result, the law created a new criminal offence of non-consensual distribution of intimate images. It also clarified that Criminal Code offences of harassing / indecent communications can be committed by any means of telecommunication. Police services are able to utilize these amendments as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them."
50,"On June 17, 2016, Bill C-14 "An Act to amend the Criminal Code to make related amendments to other Acts (medical assistance in dying)" came in effect. As a result, the law created new offences around for failing to comply with the safeguards which must be respected before medical assistance in dying may be provided to a person, for forging or destroying documents related to medical assistance in dying, for failing to provide the required information for the purpose of permitting the monitoring of medical assistance in dying and for contravening the regulations made by the Minister of Health respecting that information. Three new UCR2 violation codes were introduced in response to these amendments to the Criminal Code. Police services are able to utilize the survey revision as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them."
51,"Prior to 2016, all incidents of a Criminal Code violation which occurred within the Central East Correctional Centre (CECC) located in Lindsay, Ontario were reported under the Kawartha Lakes Police Service (35157). The majority of these offences were physical assault, breach of probation and prison unlawfully at large. In 2016, Statistics Canada began reporting the CECC data separately. As a result, comparison with previous years should be done with caution."
52,"In 2016, The Cobourg Police Service underwent a number of changes in police reporting practices. Therefore, comparisons with data previous to 2016 should be made with caution."
53,"In 2015, the Ontario Provincial Police underwent an internal realignment of detachments. As a result of this realignment, an error occurred during CCJS data production. As such, data for Temiskaming (Temiskaming Shores) 35241 is missing for the years 2015 and 2016. For further details, contact the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics at statcan.ccjcss-ccsjsc.statcan@statcan.gc.ca."
56,"Historically, police services reported bestiality offences under a single violation code. In June 2015, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) was modified to allow police to report in Bestiality in Presence of, or Incites, a Child (1381) separately from Bestiality – Commits, Compels Another Person (1380). Since police services are able to utilize these codes as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them, 2015 data should be interpreted with caution."
57,"Historically, police service reported Agreement or Arrangement - Sexual Offences Against Child (1371) under the same violation code as Luring a Child via a Computer (1370). In June 2015, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) was modified to allow police to report these violations separately. Since police services are able to utilize these codes as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them, 2015 data should be interpreted with caution."
58,"On May 18, 2017, Bill C-37 "An Act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related amendments to other Acts" came into effect. As a result, the offence of possessing, producing, selling or importing anything knowing it will be used to produce or traffic in crystal meth or ecstasy was expanded to include all substances listed in Schedule I, II , III, IV or V of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act."
59,"On November 22, 2017, new opioid (other than heroin) violation codes (4170, 4270, 4370, 4470) were added to the Uniform Crime reporting Survey. The addition of these codes is in response to the need expressed by police services to capture the prevalence of opioids using violation codes specific to this type of drug. Previously, offences related to the possession, trafficking, importation and exportation and production of opioids (other than heroin) were included under ‘other controlled drugs and substances’ (4130, 4230, 4330, 4430). Since police services are able to utilize these codes as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them, 2017 data should be interpreted with caution."
60,"Data for unfounded incidents are available for 2017 and subsequent years in order to resume collection that had been halted in 2006 due to inconsistent reporting. To improve comparability, the definition of founded and unfounded criminal incidents was revised in 2017 and any prescribed changes relating to the classification of incidents will be phased in over time starting with the reporting of 2019 data. As such, it is understood that inconsistencies in reporting may still exist in 2017 and 2018. Data may therefore be incomparable across police services."
61,"On December 12, 2017, Bill C-305 “An Act to ament the Criminal Code (mischief)” came into effect. This enactment amended the offence of mischief to property primarily used for worship to include mischief in relation to property that is used by an identifiable group (2176) for educational purposes, administrative, social, cultural or sports activities or events or as residence for seniors."
62,"Data for unfounded incidents of terrorism are not available for 2017 due to data quality concerns."
63,"On October 17, 2018, Bill C-45 “An Act respecting cannabis and to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Criminal Code and other Acts” came into effect. As a result, all prior pre-legalization cannabis-related legislation under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) has been expired and replaced with 22 new violation codes under the Cannabis Act."
64,"On June 21, 2018, Part 1 of Bill C-46 “An Act to amend the Criminal Code (relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts” came into effect. Part 2 of this legislation came into effect on December 18, 2018. As a result of this legislation, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey created 19 new violation codes and expired 15 existing traffic-specific violation codes."
65,"In 2018, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reporting practices for drug seizures reported by Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) to the RCMP in Niagara were amended to better align with the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) survey in an effort to report consistent and accurate data. Due to this amendment in reporting practices, the RCMP detachment provided an estimate of the actual number of incidents for violations in 2017. Data should therefore be used with caution."
67,"In 2019, the increase in unfounded incidents of Shoplifting $5,000 or under (2143) for Halton Police Service can be attributed to a change in reporting. Previous to 2019, incidences where gas was reported stolen but deemed to be accidental was handled under municipal legislation and not collected by Statistics Canada. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years."
68,"In 2019, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) added a new violation code (1300) to collect information on “sexual offences which occurred prior to January 4, 1983”. While most violations are not typically reported years after their occurrence, it is not uncommon for sexual violations to be reported by a victim long after the incident took place due to a variety of reasons. On January 4, 1983, Canadian legislation surrounding sexual offences changed considerably. In order to reflect these changes, the UCR added the new violation code to help record these historical offences separately from those reported under an existing violation code that does not reflect the state of Canadian legislation at the time of the offence. Data for 2018 was updated to include this new violation code."
69,"In January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes that consider the complexities of certain offences such as sexual assault, family violence and intimate partner violence. Under the new reporting standards, specific offences may be more likely reported by police as founded rather than unfounded (or unsubstantiated), which would exclude them from police-reported crime rates and crime severity indices. Data for 2019 represent the first complete year of UCR data collected under the new reporting standards.  As a result, for selected violations and police services, the actual proportion of incidents in 2019 that were classified as “not cleared” has increased. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years."
70,"A high crime rate or Crime Severity Index (CSI) may indicate that a municipality is a geographical area that provides commercial business, human or public services, or entertainment for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, these municipalities may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate and CSI calculations."
71,"Population figures reflect only the permanent or resident population of a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction serves as the centre for commercial businesses, human or public services, or entertainment, it may have substantial “part-time” populations, e.g., tourists, cabin owners, commuters, students, and seasonal staff. These temporary populations, whose permanent residence is within another jurisdiction, are excluded from a jurisdiction’s population figures. This may be a factor to consider when examining the crime rate and Crime Severity Index for some municipalities."
72,"In 2020, additional information about the types of offences that come to the attention of the Canadian National Railway Police allowed for a revision of the data classification method for the detailed federal statute offence types including the Youth Criminal Justice Act, Bankruptcy Act, among others. Revisions were applied to the 2019 figures, onward."
73,"In 2018, Bill C-46 amended the Criminal Code and other Acts and introduced new legislation for impaired driving violations. At this time, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey was adjusted to add or expire some violation codes and ensure the previous UCR impaired driving codes align with the new legislation. These UCR changes may result in different reporting practices among the police services across Canada for impaired driving violations reported to the survey."
74,"With the Government of Canada's March 2020 announcement of restrictions on persons arriving in or departing from Canada, pursuant to its powers under the Quarantine Act, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey was adjusted to add a specific Quarantine Act violation code (6600). As police services adopt this new code and adjust to the new reporting requirements, there may be data revisions made to correct any misreporting of these incidents."
75,"Trafficking in persons incidents reported to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey may be undercounted due to differences in police reporting practices for this violation."
